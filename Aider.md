# Aider

- [ ] Review `uv`-based installation, setup and usage.

- [Aider](https://aider.chat) / [GitHub](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)

## Install

**Aider** can be installed with [Homebrew](Homebrew.md) but install with [pip](Python.md).

Install **aider** with [uv](uv.md).

```shell
uv tool install --force --python python3.12 aider-chat@latest
```

Per the [installation instructions](https://aider.chat/docs/install.html), this will install **aider** in its own separate Python environment. If needed, `aider-install` will also install a separate version of Python 3.12 to use with **aider**.

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in PATH.
