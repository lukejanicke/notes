## Additional Tips

- **The "Zen" of vi:**  Thinking of vi as a language, with **verbs** (actions), **subjects** (the text to act on), and **objects** (registers, etc).
- **Marks:** Use **marks** to quickly jump to and manipulate specific locations in the text.
- **Registers:** Use **registers** to store text for copying, cutting, and pasting.
- **Combine commands**: Combine commands to create more complex operations (e.g. `ciw` to change inner word).
- **Macros**: Use **macros** to record and replay a series of commands to perform repetitive actions.
- **`CTRL-R`**: Use `CTRL-R` in insert or command mode with registers to paste contents of registers.
